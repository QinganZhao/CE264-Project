Marriage could be affected by many objective and subjective factors. This fun project is going to iteratively find out the most influential ones by analyzing our database. After determining the most direct factors that affected marriage status using [GA](https://github.com/QinganZhao/GA), we would also like to conduct several machine techniques including logistic regression, SVM, decision trees and neural networks to train with the selected features. Eventually, we will predict oneâ€˜s marriage status based on our study findings.
